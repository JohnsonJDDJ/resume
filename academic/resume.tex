        \itemdetails{
            Advised by Prof. Dacher Keltner, assembled a police aggression discernment and early warning system powered by a parallel CNN Transformer neural network using pytorch, librosa, and pyaudio. The system is capable to classify emotions from streaming real-life audio speech data:
        \vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}
            \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-4pt]
                \item Trained the network using large emotional databases (RAVDESS, SAVEE) through MS Azure cloud compute platform;
                \item Spearheaded training data preprocessing with robust data augmentation techniques including Gaussian white noise, simulated room impulse response, and randomly sampled background noise, boosting performance at evaluation time to 71\%;
                \item Realized real-time audio streaming and continuous model evaluation on a Raspberry Pi 4 device
