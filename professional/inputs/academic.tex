    \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-4pt, leftmargin=10pt]
        \item Advised by Prof. Dacher Keltner, experimented, trained, tested, and finetuned a parallel CNN Transformer neural network using pytorch and MS Azure to classify emotions from streaming real-life audio speech data;
        \item Spearheaded training data preprocessing with robust data augmentation techniques including Gaussian white noise, simulated room impulse response, and randomly sampled background noise.
        \item Boosted testing accuracy from 68\% to 71\% and ensured consistent evaluation performace on real-time audio inputs;
        \item Programmed and installed real-time audio streaming and continuous model evaluation on a Raspberry Pi 4 device by downsizing audio sample rate and performing batched evaluation to accomodate for the resource-limited platform.
