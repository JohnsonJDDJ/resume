\experience{01/2022}{present}{Research Assistance}{Project AEI}{Berkeley, CA}{Real-time audio emotion classification}
\itemdetails{
    Advised by Prof. Dacher Keltner, assembled a police aggression discernment and early warning system powered by a parallel CNN Transformer neural network using pytorch, librosa, and pyaudio. The system is capable to classify emotions from streaming real-life audio speech data:
    \vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}
    \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-4pt, leftmargin=10pt]
        \item Experimented, trained, tested, and finetuned the parallel neural system using emotional databases (\href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1188976}{\textcolor{blue}{RAVDESS}}, \href{http://kahlan.eps.surrey.ac.uk/savee/}{\textcolor{blue}{SAVEE}}) through MS Azure cloud platform;
        \item Spearheaded training data preprocessing with robust data augmentation techniques including Gaussian white noise, simulated room impulse response, and randomly sampled background noise, boosting performance at evaluation time to 71\%;
        \item Programmed and installed real-time audio streaming and continuous model evaluation on a Raspberry Pi 4 device
