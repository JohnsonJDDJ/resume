\itemdetails{
    \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-4pt, leftmargin=10pt]
        \item Implemented the Conformer neural network using PyTorch, then experimented, trained, and finetuned the model on MS Azure platform to classify streaming real-life audio speech data into seven universal emotions;
        \item Spearheaded and pipelined training data preprocessing with speech augmentation techniques including Gaussian white noise, simulated room impulse response, and randomly sampled background noise; Boosted testing accuracy from 68\% to 71\% and ensured consistent evaluation performace on real-time audio inputs;
        \item Used pyaudio and librosa to program and installed audio streaming and continuous model evaluation on a Raspberry Pi 4 device by downsizing audio sample rate and performing batched evaluation to accomodate for the resource-limited platform;

\itemdetails{
    \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-4pt, leftmargin=10pt]
        \item Performed extract-transform-load (ETL) on client FosunPharma's two major relational database, resolved conflicts with hand designed schemas, and consolidated all data into a single database;
        \item Programmed 100+ complex SQL query scripts and engineered data merger pipelines using the DBeaver ETL software;
        \item Overcame data confidentiality through extensive communication with client representatives and increased client's database system throughput by 80\%, benefiting downstream business intelligence tasks.
