        \item Implemented the Conformer neural network using PyTorch, then experimented, trained, and finetuned the model on MS Azure platform to classify streaming real-life audio speech data into seven universal emotions;
        \item Spearheaded and pipelined training data preprocessing with speech augmentation techniques including Gaussian white noise, simulated room impulse response, and randomly sampled background noise; Boosted testing accuracy from 68\% to 71\% and ensured consistent evaluation performace on real-time audio inputs;
        \item Used pyaudio and librosa to program and installed audio streaming and continuous model evaluation on a Raspberry Pi 4 device by downsizing audio sample rate and performing batched evaluation to accomodate for the resource-limited platform;
