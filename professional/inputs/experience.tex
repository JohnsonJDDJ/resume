\itemdetails{
    \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-4pt, leftmargin=10pt]
        \item Experimented, trained, tested, and finetuned a Conformer neural network using pytorch and MS Azure to classify emotions from streaming real-life audio speech data;
        \item Spearheaded and pipelined training data preprocessing with speech augmentation techniques including Gaussian white noise, simulated room impulse response, and randomly sampled background noise;
        \item Programmed and installed real-time audio streaming and continuous model evaluation on a Raspberry Pi 4 device by downsizing audio sample rate and performing batched evaluation to accomodate for the resource-limited platform;
        \item Boosted testing accuracy from 68\% to 71\% and ensured consistent evaluation performace on real-time audio inputs.

\itemdetails{
    \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-4pt, leftmargin=10pt]
        \item Merged and resolved client \href{https://www.fosunpharma.com/en/}{\textcolor{blue}{FosunPharma}}'s two conflicting relational database into one new consolidated database by designing and implementing extract-transform-load (ETL) pipelines with DBeaver and SQL;
        \item Submitted and peer-revised 100+ complex SQL query scripts for data merger pipelines constructed using DBeaver;
        \item Debugged failures and overcame data confidentiality through extensive communication with client representatives;
        \item Increased client's database system throughput by 80\% benefiting downstream business intelligence tasks.
